# HANA Cloud Instance Mapping Operator for Kyma
HANA Cloud Instance Mapping Operator automates the HANA Cloud database mapping to a Kyma namespace.

## Description
The operator manages the database mappings in a kubernetes-native way. It stores them in custom resources (CRs) in the Kyma cluster and updates the underlying HANA Cloud infrastructure by calling its mapping API.

The following diagram gives an overview of the involved custom resources (CRs) and operators in the Kyma cluster.

Database mappings are a prerequisite for deploying and consuming HDI Containers and Schemas from a Kyma namespace. 
General information about provisioning and consuming HANA Cloud databases is available on the SAP Technology Blog:

## Requirements
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.
- [SAP BTP Service Operator](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator) running on your Kyma cluster

## Download and Installation

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/hana-mapping-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/hana-mapping-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Usage
First, make sure you have a database (HANA Cloud service instance) in your landscape. One way to provision it is by deploying a ServiceInstance CR like:
```yaml
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: my-hana-instance
spec:
  serviceOfferingName: hana-cloud
  servicePlanName: hana
  parameters:
    data:
      memory: 30
      vcpu: 2
      generateSystemPassword: true
```

To get access to the mapping API (inventory service) of the HANA Cloud infrastructure the HANA Mapping Operator needs to authenticate against a special XSUAA service. Provision one service instance (plan admin-api-access) and the corresponding binding. Don't forget to set the `technicalUser` flag, it assigns all necessary scopes to access the mapping API:
```yaml
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: my-admin-instance
spec:
  serviceOfferingName: hana-cloud
  servicePlanName: admin-api-access
  parameters:
    technicalUser: true
---
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: my-admin-binding
spec:
  serviceInstanceName: my-admin-instance
  secretName: my-admin-secret
```

The credentials for authentication will be stored in a separate secret `my-admin-secret` in the same namespace as the binding.

Next, deploy the mapping CR:
```yaml
apiVersion: hana.cloud.sap.com/v1
kind: HANAMapping
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: my-hanamapping
spec:
  btpOperatorConfigmap:
    namespace: kyma-system
    name: sap-btp-operator-config
  adminAPIAccessSecret:
    namespace: my-namespace
    name: my-admin-secret
  mapping:
    serviceInstanceID: cf923d7d-7661-48f2-aaa2-d4dbb151a708
    targetNamespace: my-namespace
```

Finally, make sure the mapping is deployed successfully:
```shell
$ kubectl get hanamappings
NAME             SERVICE INSTANCE ID                    TARGET NAMESPACE   READY
my-hanamapping   cf923d7d-7661-48f2-aaa2-d4dbb151a708   my-namespace       True
```

Now, you can consume the specified HANA Cloud Service Instance in `my-namespace`.
